# 
# Am 1. September 1939 verf�gte das Deutsche Reich �ber eine Handelsflotte von 2466 Einheiten �ber 100 BRT Gr��e mit zusammen 4492000 BRT. Hierunter befanden sich 838 Einheiten �ber 1600 BRT mit 3888000 BRT.
# Diese Flotte verteilte sich am genannten Tage wie folgt:
# In der Heimat, bzw. Nord- u. Ostseefahrt	432 Schiffe
# In �berseeischen H�fen					230 Schiffe 
# Auf hoher See								176 Schiffe
# 
# R�ckkehrer								127 Schiffe
# Seit Kriegsbeginn kehrten als Blockadebrecher aus �bersee 109 Handelsschiffe mit 657 722 BRT zur�ck.
# Weiterhin wurden nach Beendigung des Frankreich-Feldzuges 18 Schiffe mit 62 417 BRT aus Westspanien nach Frankreich �berf�hrt.
#
# => Verluste: 279 Schiffe (33,2 Prozent der gro�en Schiffe ) bzw. rund 1294000 BRT (33,3 Prozent der Tonnage aller gro�en Schiffe / 29 Prozent aller Schiffe)
