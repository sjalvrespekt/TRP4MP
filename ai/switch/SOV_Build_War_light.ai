# Brigade building scheme for medium sized or mass assault countries
# note: numbers don't have to add up to 100%; building probability is path-dependent, i.e. the engine checks this list top-down
# probabilities and complementary probabilities multiply along this path; brigades not buildable are left aside
#
# desired brigade coverage: 65% (non-armored) / 90% (motorized) / 90% (armored) [cheap mass army, but well equipped elite units]
